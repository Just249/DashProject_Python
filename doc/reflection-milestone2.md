## Reflection

### Implemented Features

* All the input control (Checkbox, Ranger Sliders) are functional and can control the charts
* The two tabs are set up to group the visualisations into two main sections : namely “General Information Tab” and “Filterable Tab”
* All charts are linked to the datasets and can be refreshed instantly upon the change of the input values.
* Tooltips are added as a follow up of the comment from the peer review session
* The application is successfully deployed and published to herokuapp.com

### Not-Yet-implemented Features/Items

* The herokuapp link https://data551-dashproject-python.herokuapp.com/ is created, but for some reason we have to pay in order to get it running. We will showcase it to the TA/Teacher that it is working.
* A suggestion was collected during the Peer Review session to add some sorts of "error measure" in the charts like the error bar in line plot, in order to facilitate the users to identify and determine whether the difference in the values are statistically significant or now.  Due to the potential major changes of the charts implementation, this suggestion has not looked into details at this stage but may be explored at a later phase. 

### Limitation

* Because of the adoption of iframe, the display of the charts may not be very responsive.  When the app is viewed across different mobile devices with varying screen resolution, the complete charts may not be viewable easily.

### Good Future Improvement and additions

* We will look into the feasibility of a feature suggestion to add some “error measures” in the charts, so as to facilitate the users to be able to assess the statistical significance of the difference in the statistical values more conveniently.  However, it is possible that some chart types may need to be adjusted as the “error measures” may not be supported in all chart types. If possible, we may include an error bar along the lines to show confidence interval or standard error.
