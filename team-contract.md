## Team Work Contract

#### Goal
- Design and Develop a usuable Visualisation Daskboard for our project intended audience.

#### Work Distribution
- Work is distributed through mutual negotiation and consensus after discussion.  
- Work is shared as evenly as possible.  
- But we trust that team members need not be over-calculative, and we should learn to be accommodating and supportive to each others as a team.
- Work can be arranged according to the talent, competency, interest of individual members and previous experience, subject to the team's consensus.

#### Group Meeting and Administration
- A face-to-face progress review and planning meeting is arranged at least once a week.
- Each project meeting takes about one hour.
- Other project discussion, updates, coordination will be done in the discord project area.
- Members should check the discord area at least once for every two days, and respond to the discussion, enquiries or call for comment, if any.
- All project members share the same role.  No particular designation is arranged.  According to previous positive experience, we have solid evidence to trust that all of our project members are motivated and responsible team-players, and are able to show respect to the project and the members.

#### Working Style and Quality Requirement
- Members should raise for discussion and get project team consensus before changing the project direction and major design. 
- Members should update their work progress in the discord project area regularly (e.g. at least once a day) if there are any work completed and pushed into the project repo in that day.
- Members are obligated to undertake sufficient testings before pushing their codes into the project github repo to ensure the project code quality.
- If members are away for the project for more than two days (e.g. long trip), members should notify the project team at least two days before.


#### Contract Administration
- This contract should only be added or altered with the agreement of all the project team members.
